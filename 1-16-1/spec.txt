Epic Enchantments Spec



Goal: Extra abilities for swords and other tools, so that players can create and use swords with special capabilities (or "epic enchantments").

Purpose: To add more variety to the weapons without requiring client-side mods.

Implementation:
	- NBT data for items with epic enchantments. Items that have an epic enchantment will have an NBT tag like the following:
		{
			LeftBindings: [
				{
					Commands: [command],
					Activation: [all|entity|block],
					AsPlayer: (true|false),
					KillingStroke: (true|false)
				},
				...
			],
			RightBindings: [
				{
					Commands: [command],
					Activation: [all|entity|block|air],
					Radius: [float],
					AsPlayer: (true|false)
				},
				...
			]
		}
		
		where LeftBindings and RightBindings are arrays of epic enchantments that will be run when the player left clicks or right clicks, respectively.
		
		
		There are several different circumstances in which a command may be executed:
			1. The player clicks an entity within reach distance
			2. The player clicks a block within reach distance
			3. The player clicks open air, but is looking at a block within radius
			4. The player clicks open air and is not looking at a block within radius
			
		For cases 1 and 2 (but not 3 and 4), left clicking is supported. Bindings can be added to a weapon that will run a command
		when either case 1 or case 2 is true. This is because it is not possible to detect when the player left clicks open air
		without client-side mods.
		
		The Activation.LeftClick enum for a binding can be one of:
			"all": 		The command is executed for cases 1 and 2
			"entity": 	The command is executed for case 1
			"block": 	The command is executed for cases 2 and 3
		
		A binding with 'KillingStroke: true' will only fire when the player's attack kills an entity. This means that 'KillingStroke' is ignored for
		"block" activations.
		
		
		For all cases, right clicking is supported. Bindings can be added to a weapon that will run a command when the player right clicks on anything.
		
		The Activation.RightClick enum for a binding can be one of:
			"all":		The command is executed for cases 1, 2, and 3
			"entity":	The command is executed for case 1
			"block":	The command is executed for cases 2 and 3
			"air":		The command is executed for cases 3 and 4
			
		The 'AsPlayer' boolean dictates who runs the command. If this is true, the player will run the command; if not, the target (if it exists) will run the command.
		

	- /bind command to apply a binding to the player's held item, with a syntax like
		/bind <(left|right)> <activation> <asPlayer> [radius] <command>
